There are four .html documents within this repo.

The one being used currently is size.html and white.html

White.html is a pure white page, used to display a white block as the colour block option on the system doesnt work as required.

The size.html takes the embedded link for the created PDF at the end of the flow for our front of house system, positions it on the web page, and displays it.
